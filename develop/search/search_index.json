The checks are: 1. check no large files have been staged, 2. lint python files for major errors, 3. format python files to conform with the PEP8 standard. You can also run these checks yourself at any time to ensure staged changes are clean by calling <code>pre-commit</code>.</li> <li><code>pytest</code> - run the unit test suite and check test coverage.</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>If you already have an environment called <code>tastail1</code> on your system (e.g., for a stable installation of the package), you will need to chose a different environment name.

The test suite includes unit tests and integration tests (in the form of jupyter notebooks found in the <code>examples</code> directory). The integration tests can be slow, so if you want to avoid them during development, you should run <code>pytest tests/</code>. 2. You can avoid generating coverage reports, by adding the <code>--no-cov</code> argument: <code>pytest --no-cov</code>. 3.

When run from the root directory of this repo, <code>pyproject.toml</code> should ensure that formatting and linting fixes are in line with our custom preferences (e.g., 100 character maximum line length). The philosophy behind using <code>black</code> is to have uniform style throughout the project dictated by code. Since <code>black</code> is designed to minimise diffs, and make patches more human readable, this also makes code reviews more efficient. To make this a smooth experience, you should run <code>pre-commit install</code> after setting up your development environment, so that <code>black</code> makes all the necessary fixes to your code each time you commit, and so that <code>ruff</code> will highlight any errors in your code. If you prefer, you can also set up your IDE to run these two tools whenever you save your files, and to have <code>ruff</code> highlight erroneous code directly as you type. Take a look at their documentation for more information on configuring this.</p> <p>We require all new contributions to have docstrings for all modules, classes and methods.
